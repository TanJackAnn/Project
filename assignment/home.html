                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Hello everyone, I am <strong>Tan Jack Ann</strong>, a pastry chef. With many years of baking
                    experience and passion
                    for pastry making and innovation. I pay attention to the quality of the ingredients and love working
                    with local suppliers and choosing fresh, organic ingredients to create delicious desserts and cakes.
                    I enjoy working with teams to create amazing baked goods. I hope companies will hire me to showcase
                    my skills and creativity to bring delicious and enjoyable experiences to customers. </p>
                <h3>My Expertise</h3>
                <p><strong>These are techniques I've learned from experience over time:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="small">Creative Design</li>
                    <li class="small">Pastry Decoration</mark></li>
                    <li class="small">Recipe and Ingredient Knowledge</li>
                    <li class="small">Use of Baking Equipment and Tools</li>
                    <li class="small">Bakery Technology</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I consider myself to be a professional with extensive experience and skills in the field of baking,
                    and I can create mouth-watering dessert works of art through my mastery of the baking process and my

                <h3>Consequences would effect these parts</h3>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>Weather</li>
                    <p>The rise in average temperature leads to an increase in the rate of water evaporation from the
                        atmosphere, resulting in more intense and widespread droughts. Consequently, we can anticipate a
                        growing occurrence of extremely hot heat waves</p>
                    <li>Agriculture</li>
                    <p>In a world experiencing global warming, the cultivation of crops becomes more uncertain, and
                        raising livestock, which are susceptible to extreme weather, becomes increasingly challenging.
                        This situation can result in a shortage of food.</p>
                    <li>Human</li>
                    <p>Air quality deteriorates as a result of climate change, leading to heightened exposure to harmful
                        wildfire by warmer conditions. Additionally, it would cause displacement too. People would be
                        suffering from the impact like shortage of food and water.</p>
